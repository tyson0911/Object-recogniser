Object recognition is a subfield of computer vision and artificial intelligence that focuses on
identifying and classifying objects within an image or video. It involves the use of
algorithms and models to detect objects, determine their locations, and often assign labels
to them based on predefined categories. This technology is integral to various applications,
such as autonomous driving, surveillance, medical imaging, and augmented reality. Object recognition systems 
typically rely on machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, to achieve high levels of accuracy and efficiency.

An effective object recognizer is characterized by its accuracy, speed, and robustness across
various conditions and environments. Continuous advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning,
have significantly enhanced the capabilities of object recognizers, enabling them to handle more complex and diverse visual data.
